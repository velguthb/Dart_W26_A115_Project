nuc_burn.py is the main script with only functions defined. the burn() function is the only function you need from here. 
you should import nuc_burn at the top of your script.
- nuc_burn.burn() takes inputs of temp: float, rho: float, time: float, comp=None
'temp', 'rho', and 'comp' should be arrays. 'time' is your time step in seconds. 
burn() outputs the delta energy, mean molecular mass, and mass fraction results for your given time step.
* for the very first time step, leave 'comp' as none (it calls a function with an initial composition)
* for the following time steps, update 'comp' with the previous 'mass_frac' burn() output

To run burn() within a time stepping function without a bunch of stuff outputting to your terminal,
use burn() within a script and call the script with:
python myscript.py > stdout 2>&1 
- you can then type 'cat stdout' to see the logging of your code if you want to check for errors or anything. 

Example usage: 
- For initial run
temps = np.linspace(1.5e7, 2e7, 100)
rhos = np.linspace(1.5e2, 1.5e2, 100)
e, mu, mf = nuc_burn.burn(temps, rhos, 1000)
- For following run
e2, mu2, mf2 = nuc_burn.burn(newtemp, newrho, 1000, mf)
- and so on...

scratch.py has the same code as nuc_burn.py, but is where I played with stuff and left messy comments for myself. 
this code can be run + altered if needed for trouble-shooting. it has arrays with dummy values defined for temp and rho at the end of the script, and a print statement.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test.py is simply testing the importing of nuc_burn and the functionality of burn() with dummy values for temp and rho.
